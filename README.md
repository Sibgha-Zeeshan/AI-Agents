# Vacuum-Cleaner-Problem
Creating Intelligent Agents:
Objective:  simulating the classic "vacuum world" problem, where Vacuum Cleaner agent is tasked with cleaning a set of rooms.

Defining the Environment
A room with two squares: A and B. Each square can be either Clean or Dirty.

Defining the Agent:
The vacuum agent can move Left or Right.
The vacuum agent can Suck dirt (clean the square).
The vacuum agent can sense its location and whether the square is dirty.

A simple reflex agent is implemented that reacts to its percepts by performing actions based on predetermined condition-action rules. It perceives its environment and follows a prescribed action if a certain condition is met.
